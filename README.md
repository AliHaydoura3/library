# Library

## Overview

The **Library App** is a project created as part of the [JavaScript course on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). It showcases core JavaScript concepts, including object constructors, DOM manipulation, and user interactions with forms. The app allows users to create, display, and manage a collection of books.

## Features

- **Add a New Book**: Users can input details (title, author, pages, and read status) for a new book using a form.
- **Book Display**: The books are displayed on the page in a table format, showing all relevant details.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can toggle the read status of any book.
- **Remove a Book**: Each book can be removed from the library with a simple button click.

## Project Details

This project was built using:

- **HTML** for structuring the page.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for functionality and interactivity.

The books are stored in an array, with methods for adding, displaying, and removing books. No persistent data storage is implemented in this version.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-app.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Click the "Add New Book" button to open the form.
2. Fill in the book details and submit the form.
3. The book will be added to the display and can be toggled or removed.

## Future Enhancements

- Add local storage to persist the library between sessions.
- Implement a search function to find books in the collection.
- Add more user-friendly form validation.
